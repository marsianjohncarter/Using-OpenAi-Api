# Using-OpenAi-Api
If you have ever used `ChatGPT`, you know how useful the thing is. `OpenAi` (ChatGPT's owners) provide an `API` for `ChatGPT`, meaning you can use it through your conosle or terminal. I am going to guide you through the initial steps.
First, you need to do is create a new (it's free) account on `OpenAi` (if you don't have one already), and create a new `API` key <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys">at this url</a>. Make sure you are logged in!

<i>You can call your api key anything you want.</i>

Now you can use `ChatGPT` in your terminal! Just copy or download the project file and replace:

```python
openai.api_key = 'sk-************************************************'
```
with your own key. Happy coding!
